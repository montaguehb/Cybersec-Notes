Find the IP address of a domain name using `nslookup`, which stands for Name Server Look Up. You need to issue the command `nslookup DOMAIN_NAME`, for example, `nslookup tryhackme.com`. Or, more generally, you can use `nslookup OPTIONS DOMAIN_NAME SERVER`

- OPTIONS contains the query type as shown in the table below. For instance, you can use `A` for IPv4 addresses and `AAAA` for IPv6 addresses.
- DOMAIN_NAME is the domain name you are looking up.
- SERVER is the DNS server that you want to query. You can choose any local or public DNS server to query. Cloudflare offers `1.1.1.1` and `1.0.0.1`, Google offers `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`, and Quad9 offers `9.9.9.9` and `149.112.112.112`. There are many [more public DNS servers](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=public+dns) that you can choose from if you want alternatives to your ISP’s DNS servers.
