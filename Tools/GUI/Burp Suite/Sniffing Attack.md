Sniffing attack refers to using a network packet capture tool to collect information about the target. When a protocol communicates in cleartext, the data exchanged can be captured by a third party to analyse. A simple network packet capture can reveal information, such as the content of private messages and login credentials, if the data isn't encrypted in transit.

There are many programs available to capture network packets including the following:

1. **[[Tcpdump]]** is a free open source command-line interface (CLI) program that has been ported to work on many operating systems.
2. **[[Wireshark]]** is a free open source graphical user interface (GUI) program available for several operating systems, including Linux, macOS and MS Windows.
3. **[[Tshark]]** is a CLI alternative to Wireshark.
