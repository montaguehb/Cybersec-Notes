# Pen Testing Methodologies

In order to best approach pen testing, it's important to have a methodology in place that changes depending on what's being tested

While different methodologies will vary depending on what you're pen testing, they generally have the following themes.

|                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Information Gathering | This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organisation as possible, for example, OSINT and research.<br><br>**Note:** This does not involve scanning any systems.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Enumeration/Scanning  | This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Exploitation          | This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Privilege Escalation  | Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator). |
| Post-exploitation     | This stage involves a few sub-stages:  <br><br>**1.** What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting)<br><br>**2.** What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user<br><br>**3.**  Covering your tracks<br><br>**4.** Reporting                                                                                                            |

As for specifics, a couple of examples are as following

## OSSTMM
[The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf) provides a detailed framework of testing strategies for various things.

It's mainly used for telecoms, wired networks, and wireless communication

## OWASP

The "[Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/)" framework is a community-driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services.

The foundation regularly [writes reports](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/) stating the top ten security vulnerabilities a web application may have, the testing approach, and remediation.

**NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1**

The [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) is a popular framework used to improve an organisations cybersecurity standards and manage the risk of cyber threats. This framework is a bit of an honourable mention because of its popularity and detail.

The framework provides guidelines on security controls & benchmarks for success for organisations from critical infrastructure (power plants, etc.) all through to commercial.  There is a limited section on a standard guideline for the methodology a penetration tester should take.

## NCSC CAF

The [Cyber Assessment Framework](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/caf/caf-principles-and-guidance) (CAF) is an extensive framework of fourteen principles used to assess the risk of various cyber threats and an organisation's defences against these.

The framework applies to organisations considered to perform "vitally important services and activities" such as critical infrastructure, banking, and the likes. The framework mainly focuses on and assesses the following topics:

- Data security
- System security
- Identity and access control
- Resiliency
- Monitoring
- Response and recovery planning

# Different types of Pen testing

# Black-box

A high level process where the tester is given no information on the inner workings of the application or service.

# Grey-box

Most popular for things like pen testing, it's a combination of black and white box hacking in which the tester has limited knowledge of the internal components of the application or software.

# White-box

A low-level process done by a software engineer with full knowledge of the application or software
