Reconnaissance (recon) can be defined as a preliminary survey to gather information about a target. It is the first step in [[Network Security#Cyber kill chain|Cyber Kill Chain]] to gain an initial foothold on a system. We divide reconnaissance into:

1. Passive Reconnaissance
2. Active Reconnaissance

In passive reconnaissance, you rely on publicly available knowledge. It is the knowledge that you can access from publicly available resources without directly engaging with the target. Think of it like you are looking at target territory from afar without stepping foot on that territory.

Passive reconnaissance activities include many activities, for instance:

- Looking up DNS records of a domain from a public DNS server.
- Checking job ads related to the target website.
- Reading news articles about the target company.

This differs from [[Active Reconnaissance]] where you directly engage the target.
