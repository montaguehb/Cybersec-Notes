# Threat Modelling

Threat modelling is the process of reviewing, improving, and testing the security protocols in place in an organization's information technology infrastructure and services.

The principles are, generally speaking, as follows:
- Preparation
- Identification
- Mitigations
- Review

An effective threat model includes:

- Threat intelligence
- Asset identification
- Mitigation capabilities
- Risk assessment

Multiple models and frameworks exist to help with this process; some of the more common ones are [[STRIDE]] and [[PASTA]]

# Incident Response

Any breach of security is an incident, and will happen. Actions taken to resolve and remediate the threat are known as [[Incident Response]] (IR)

Incidents are classified using a rating of urgency and impact

An incident is responded to by a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) which is prearranged group of employees with technical knowledge about the systems and/or current incident. To successfully solve an incident, these steps are often referred to as the six phases of Incident Response

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Action**|**Description**|
|Preparation|Do we have the resources and plans in place to deal with the security incident?|
|Identification|Has the threat and the threat actor been correctly identified in order for us to respond to?|
|Containment|Can the threat/security incident be contained to prevent other systems or users from being impacted?|
|Eradication|Remove the active threat.|
|Recovery|Perform a full review of the impacted systems to return to business as usual operations.|
|Lessons Learned|What can be learnt from the incident? I.e. if it was due to a phishing email, employees should be trained better to detect phishing emails.|
