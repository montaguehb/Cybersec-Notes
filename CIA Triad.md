# Overview

CIA is an information security model that should be considered when creating security policies

Broken down into 3 sections, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. The model should help determine the value of data.

Instead of having individual sections, it's a "continuous" model in that if 1 section is not met, then the others are worthless as well. 

A brief description of each is as follows

- [[CIA Triad#Confidentiality|Confidentiality]]: You want to ensure that secret and private files and information are only available to intended persons.
- [[CIA Triad#Integrity|Integrity]]: It is crucial that no one can tamper with the files stored on your system or while being transferred on the network.
- [[CIA Triad#Availability|Availability]]: You want your laptop or smartphone to be available to use anytime you decide to use it.

# Confidentiality

Goal: The protection of data from unauthorized access or misuse. To provide confidentiality is to protect this data from parties that it is not intended for.

examples
- employee records and accounting documents. Ensuring that only HR or individual employees can access their specific record.
- Classified government documents. Ensuring people have the appropriate access to view given documents

# Integrity

Goal: Information is kept accurate and consistent unless authorized changes are made. Integrity is maintained when the information remains unchanged during storage, transmission, and usage not involving modification to the information.


# Availability

Goal: In order for data to be useful, it must be available and accessible by the user.

Availability is very often a key benchmark for an organization. For example, having 99.99% uptime on their websites or systems (this is laid out in Service Level Agreements), and is achieved through many things including but not limited to the following.
- Having reliable and well-tested hardware for their information technology servers (i.e. reputable servers)
- Having redundant technology and services in the case of failure of the primary
- Implementing well-versed security protocols to protect technology and services from attack
